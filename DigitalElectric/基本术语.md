### SDRAM

SRAM-based programmable logic arrays is illustrated in Figure 69(a). A SRAM-type memory cell is used to turn a transistor on or off to connect or disconnect rows and columns. For example, when the memory cell contains a 1 (green), the transistor is on and connects the associated row and column lines, as shown in part (b). When the memory cell contains a 0 (blue), the transistor is off so there is no connection between the lines, as shown in part (c).
